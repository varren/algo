This repo is used to store my implementation of different algorithms.

If you find any mistakes or bugs in the code please let me know.
Also please let me know if you feel that I have misinterpreted the algorithm or implemented it in non-optimal way.
Contact e-mail: innevolution@gmail.com

I will write most of my code in C, but will probably keep several versions in Java, Python, some Lisp dialect, Haskell and JavaScript

I belive this repo will be active for years and i don`t expect to write everything in a couple of monthes.
